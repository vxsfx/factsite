> A range of websites employ a variety of techniques to convey and explain facts.  
>One such example is full fact. Full fact promotes a Promise of fighting "bad infomation". the promise is clearly displayed on the homepage, illistrating to users the websites purpose.

</div>
The mobile version of the website scales some elements, and changes the layout as not all elements fit across. this prevents elements becoming too small, preventing the user to read and properly interpret the page.

Reducing the navbar into a dropdown also helps leviate page readability. 


<div style="padding-top:40%"></div>

Both versions provide identical functionality, but are pressented differently for compatibility with each type of system.


<!--sadksakdsad-->
The website includes a seacrh bar for querying facts, using text input. search bar is present on both the homepage and on the navbar (shown when dropdown active on mobile). 

Although the website provide functionality to search facts, and sort them by relevency or date, it could be found diffulcault to find facts on specific topics. 

if one wanted to find the statistics of the percentage of science that is maths related, it would return

This could be in relation high relevency to the query has not been published, therefore meaning the highest relevency is actually irrelevent.

This problem couldve been leviated if they provided catogeries or genres as options, to minimise irrelevent searches. if provided search and tags, any irrelevent facts would not be returned. 
if nothing is returned this would indicate it does not exist.
<!--sadksakdsad-->

Fullfact includes some recent facts on the homepage, highlighting  recent factual events. Users can click/tap on the articles to take them to a dedicated article page, providing further infomation.
